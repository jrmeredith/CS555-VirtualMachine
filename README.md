# CS555-VirtualMachine
Final Project Virtual Machine

This is my semester project for CS 555.  I will attempt to create a virtual machine that will compile a simple,
high level, programming language.

SASM, Stack-VM, and MyVm all need to be compiled separately into their own binaries. When they are each compiled,  
run MyVM to interacte with the Virtual Machine.  You will be able to input data and the results will be returned.
